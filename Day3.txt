Day 3- Frontend development learning 
-------------------------------------
Today I learned the basic structure of an HTML webpage and how each part works

1. I learned how to create paragraphs using the <p> tag.

2. I practiced creating a list using the <ul> and <li> tags to display items.

3. I used an anchor tag <a> to create a clickable email link.

4. I understood how HTML structure helps in building clean and readable webpages.
