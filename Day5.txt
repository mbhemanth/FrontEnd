Day 5-Frontend Development Learning
--------------------------------------

Today I started learning the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). 
CSS is used to style HTML pages and make them look better.

Here is what I learned today:

1. CSS can be added in three ways:
   - Inline CSS (inside a tag)
   - Internal CSS (inside <style> in <head>)
   - External CSS (in a separate .css file)

2. I learned how to change text color, background color, and font size.

3. I practiced adding padding, margin, and borders to elements.

4. CSS helps control the layout and design of the entire webpage.
