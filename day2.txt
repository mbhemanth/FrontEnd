 I learned the basic structure of an HTML webpage and how each part works.

1. I understood how the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser that the page is written in HTML5.

2. I learned the purpose of the <html>, <head>, and <body> sections:
   - <head> contains the title and meta information.
   - <body> contains all the visible content of the webpage.

3. I used headings like <h1> and <h2> to organize the content properly.
